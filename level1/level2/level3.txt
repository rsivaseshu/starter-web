Digital technology has transformed how people communicate, and it has impacted every aspect of the relationship between consumers and the businesses they patronize. Traditional advertising campaigns that rely on a few attractive images and a list of product benefits simply don't work anymore. Consumers are paying less attention to the endless barrage of banner and pop-up ads, and most are opting-out of such marketing tactics altogether. Today, more than 615 million devices are protected with ad-blocking software, which prevents users from being exposed to unwanted advertising messages.
